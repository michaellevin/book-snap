# Project TODO List

## Important
- [x] Shutdown during downloading
- [x] Shutdown before creating PDF
- [x] Add logic for SPHL Library handling
- [ ] Handle Semaphores (SPHL should be able to download only 1 book at the same time, PRLIB can download 3 books at the same time. I guess it should be taken from Strategy's attr)
- [ ] Get rid of curl > use requests everywhere instead

## Secondary
- [ ] update README.md (make it more readable)
- [ ] update Library.drawio
- [ ] Remove image files after creating PDF

## On hold
- [ ] Make User Interface (Flutter?)
- [ ] Make CLI (Python?)
- [ ] Make package (Poetry?)
